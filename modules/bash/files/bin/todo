# This is the greatest TODO list ever!
# It is heavily based on the idea and the code
# from here: 
# 
# https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/todo
# 
# But, instead of using empty files, I use empty folders.
# This is useful for those TODO items which might need 
# some extra files grouped for the task complition.
# 
# I also have a "TODO: " prefix for the folder name, so that
# I won't get confused as easily, and also so that I could
# actually list my TODO items by running the script without
# any parameters.

set -e

if [ "$#" -eq 0 ]
then
	# Remove the prefix when listing.  But annoying when you
	# try to tab-complete the filename for deletion.
	#ls -d -1 ~/Desktop/TODO:* | sed -e 's#.*/##' -e 's/TODO: //'
	ls -d -1 ~/Desktop/TODO:* | sed -e 's#.*/##' 
else
	mkdir ~/Desktop/"TODO: $*"
