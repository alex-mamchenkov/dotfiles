DOTFILES
========

This repository contains most of my "movable" setup.  Mostly these are configurations
for bash shell, git version control, and Vim text editor.

Installation
------------

Download and run the install script, which will fetch all the necessary modules and create
all the necessary links.  Switching to your home directory and backing up your current setup
is a good idea, since:

1. The installation script will create symlinks in your CURRENT directory.
2. The installation script will remove necessary files in your CURRENT directory.
